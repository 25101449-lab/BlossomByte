            <h1 class="headings">🌸 COMPUTER HARDWARE 🌸</h1>
            <p class="p1">A general-purpose electronic counting device used in data processing due to its accuracy and high speed is called a computer. It is composed of two main components: hardware and software. The hardware refers to the physical components of a computer which includes the central processing unit and peripheral equipment for data input, output, and storage. Input devices, such as a keyboard and mouse, allow users to enter data, while output devices, like monitors and printers, display or produce information (Frankenfeld, 1993).</p>
            <p class="p2">Tangible items that can be touched or seen are called hardware components where it is required to be able for a computer to function. There are two classifications of hardware: external and internal. This refers to the placement of physical parts around the device that is responsible for the functionality and use of computers. External includes keyboards, keyboard cases, etc., while internal includes video card, memory, or central processing unit (Denomme & Zandbergen, 2023).</p>
            <p class="p3">Components that are fitted together inside a computer case to perform a task are called hardware components where it can be touched and seen. It includes lots of parts that perform their own functions that helps with the overall functioning of a computer. It includes: Motherboard, Central processing unit (CPU), Random access memory (RAM), Storage drive (HDD or SSD), Graphics processing unit (GPU), Keyboard, mouse, and monitors (Crucial, 2025).</p>
            <p class="p4">The collective term “computer hardware” is used to describe any parts that are physical of an analog or computer. While software consists of written, machine-readable programs, the hardware accepts the instructions and executes them. Hardware is categorized into two: internal and external where internal components are necessary for the proper functioning of the computer, while external components are parts that are attached to the computer and add functionality (Awati & Rosencrance, 2021).</p>
            <p class="p5">Computer hardware extends far beyond traditional desktop computers. It now also powers everything such as enterprise servers, cloud data, smartphones, vehicles, smart medical devices, and other technologies. People stay connected and businesses operate due to the widespread integration of computer hardware. It is the backbone of operations which allows efficient data flow and drives innovation (Sunsjara & Smalley, 2025).</p>

            <h1 class="headings">🌸 SOFTWARE 🌸</h1>
            <p class="p1">In a computer system, the software is basically a set of instructions or commands that tell a computer to do a specific task that serves its users. It makes the hardware work as per user requirements by giving instructions. Examples of software are MS-Word, MS-Excel, PowerPoint and Web Browser. It is composed of two different types: system software and application software. System software is a language processor and device driver, while application software gives special functions or provides functions (GeeksforGeeks, 2025).</p>
            
            <h3 class="system">🌸 System Software</h3>
            <p class="p2">A program that is designed to run a computer’s hardware and applications that also manages resources, memories, processors, and devices is called a system software. It provides a platform that runs application softwares and other softwares that are typically bundled with a computer’s operating system. There are different types of system software: operating system, device drivers, firmware, basic input/output system and unified extensible firmware interface, and programming language translator (Kitthu, 2025).</p>
            <p class="p3">A  software that provides a platform for application software to function efficiently and manage and coordinate operations of computer hardware is called system software. It enables the connection and control of components such as the CPU, RAM, hard drives, and other devices, and it is considered as the “heart” of every computer system. Its key functions are: manage system resources, provide an operating environment for application software, control and monitor system activities, ensure system security and protection, optimize system performance, and etc. (Trang, 2025).</p>
            
            <h3 class="system">🌸 Application Software</h3>
            <p class="p4">A software that aids end users and perform specific functions that deals with a direct interaction is called an application software. It lets users do specific tasks that involve in applications such as web browsers, microsoft word, and excel, which are examples of application software that can be used or accessed through computers. It can also be found in smartphones such as, whatsapp, telegram, games like candy crush, and ludo. Weather and transportation information can also be found in apps that can help people in their everyday lives as they rely on it (Satish, 2025).</p>
            <p class="p5">Application software consists of specialized programs designed to help users perform specific tasks on their computers. Unlike system software, which manages hardware and basic operations, application software focuses on day-to-day user activities. It turns computing power into practical tools for problem-solving, content creation, and communication, offering benefits such as improved productivity, cost efficiency, accuracy, customization, collaboration, and accessibility (VirtuBox, 2025).</p>

            <h2 class="conthead">The following are compared according to: processing speed, memory capacity, power consumption, minimum and usage.</h2>
            <p class="p1">The implementation of hardware and software can demonstrate how effective integration can create a cost-efficient and functional network system. By using locally assembled computers, open-source operating systems, and Cisco switches, the institution are able to reduce expenses on purchasing and maintenance while still ensuring reliable connectivity. The system’s ability to support over 100 users across multiple buildings highlights how the strategic use of both hardware and software can enhance accessibility, efficiency, and scalability—serving as a practical model for other rural or low-budget organizations (Agustian, 2025).</p>
            <p class="p2">In addition, implementation of hardware and software through two Electronic Health Record systems, OpenMRS-based and Microsoft-based, highlights the impact of technology integration in healthcare institutions. These systems, supported by proper hardware and user training, improved clinical documentation, laboratory work, pharmacy management, and reporting. This shows that while hardware and software can greatly enhance healthcare efficiency and record management, their effectiveness relies on proper adaptation to the environment and user readiness (Elepaño, 2025).</p>
            <p class="p3">Furthermore, implementation of hardware and software through a web-based healthcare platform also demonstrates how technology can greatly improve medical coordination and accessibility. With proper hardware and network infrastructure across partner facilities, the system enabled efficient provider referrals, case triage, and communication among healthcare workers. Its success highlights how integrated digital systems can enhance access to specialist care, streamline operations, and overcome geographical and resource limitations within the healthcare community (Punzalan, 2025).</p>
            <p class="p4">Another thing is, the implementation of hardware and software in redesigning the campus network shows how technological upgrades can strengthen institutional operations. By using improved switches and a hierarchical network structure with core, distribution, and access layers, the system achieved greater reliability, scalability, and service quality. This enhanced infrastructure allowed wider coverage across buildings and better management of both administrative and academic data traffic, demonstrating how effective hardware and software integration supports smoother communication and overall campus efficiency (Mulyawan, 2012).</p>
            <p class="p5">Overall, the implementation of hardware and software in special education highlights how technology can enhance learning when properly supported. The use of assistive devices, educational software, and trained educators improved accessibility and teaching effectiveness for students with special needs (Fakrudeen, 2017).</p>

            <h1 class="headings">🌸 ANALYSIS 🌸</h1>

            <p class="p1">I learned all about hardware, software and its types, and the implementation of it in different institutions. First of all, I learned that hardware are physical parts or components of a computer that have their own personal functions which helps the computer to run as a whole. There are various types of hardware that sit inside a computer case or the parts that let you take inputs and show outputs. Input parts include keyboard, mouse, and controllers while outputs include the monitor or speakers. Overall, hardware components take instruction from software which lets the computer function as it is supposed to.</P>
            <p class="p2">Second, I learned all about software and its type. Software is a collection of commands or instructions that direct a computer to perform specific tasks for its users. It enables the hardware to operate according to user needs by providing the necessary guidance and control. There are two types of software: system software and application software, which are different from each other. System software is the one that provides a platform for application softwares, which application software is the one that can be used and manipulated by users for entertainment purposes or business. Software has various uses that aid users in completing their daily tasks. </p>
            <p class="p3">Lastly, I learned that the implementation of hardware and software helps institutions like hospitals, schools, homes, and the community overall in various ways. It does not only assist every person in the community, but also the community itself such as the improvement and use of innovative technology. In conclusion, hardware and software helps us in many different ways and it can greatly enhance productivity, communication, and access to information across all areas of life. Through their proper implementation, institutions can operate more efficiently, deliver better services, and adapt to the growing demands of the digital age. </p>
