            <h1 class="headings">🌸 COMPUTER 🌸</h1>
            <p class="p1">A computer is an electronic machine that can carry out calculations and is able to store information. A computer is an electronic machine that works under the control of instructions kept in its memory. It can take data as input, process it following certain rules, produce output or information, and save that information for later use. In general, a digital computer performs five main tasks: it receives data, stores it, processes it to create useful information, and gives out results. Its main parts are hardware and software, which work together to make the computer operate properly. Throughout the years, many different types of computers have been developed (Digital Unite, 2023).</p>

            <h1 class="headings">🌸 DISCUSSION 🌸</h1>
            <p class="p1">Over the years, computers have developed into many different types and designs. This growth happened mainly because of the need for better performance, proper cooling systems, and smaller sizes that save space. As technology improved, computers became faster, more efficient, and more compact. These types of computers include supercomputers, mainframes, minicomputers, servers, workstations, and microcomputers.</p>
            
            <h2 class="syst">🌸 Supercomputer</h2>
            <p class="p2">A supercomputer is a very powerful computer that works at a very high speed compared to normal computers. It is usually used in science and engineering fields that need to handle big data or do lots of calculations. With new technology like multicore processors and GPU, there are now smaller but still powerful machines called desktop or GPU supercomputers. In simple terms, a supercomputer is known for its high performance, and there are only a few of them that can run much faster than others (Kirvan & Lutkevich, 2025).</p>
           
            <h3 class="syst">🌸 Mainframe Computers</h3>
            <p class="p3">Mainframes are powerful data servers made to handle up to a trillion web transactions each day with strong security and reliability. They have big memory and processors that can do billions of calculations and transactions in real-time. Mainframes are important for business databases, transaction systems, and apps that need high safety and stability. Even with the rise of the internet and cloud computing, mainframes are not outdated—they continue to evolve and stay an important part of modern IT systems (Susnjara & Smalley, 2025).</p>
            
            <h3 class="syst">🌸 Mini Computers</h3>
            <p class="p3">A minicomputer is a medium-sized computer that fits between big mainframes and small microcomputers. It is used for running tasks in small to medium businesses, schools, and labs. Minicomputers are cheaper, smaller, and can support several users at once. They don’t have as much power as mainframes but are more affordable and easier to install. While mainframes handle thousands of users, minicomputers usually serve a smaller group and are best for medium-scale work that doesn’t need very heavy computing (Lenovo, 2023).</p>

            <h3 class="syst">🌸 Server</h3>
            <p class="p3">A server is a computer or system that shares data, programs, or services to other computers called clients through a network. Basically, when a computer gives resources to others, it acts as a server. There are different kinds like web servers, mail servers, and virtual servers. A device can also be both a server and a client at the same time, since it can share and receive data. In the past, the first servers were mainframes or minicomputers. As technology advanced, servers became smaller and faster compared to older systems, but still more powerful than regular desktop computers.A server differs from other computers because it is designed to share resources and data with multiple users at once, run continuously with high reliability, and has more powerful hardware for managing networks and services (Paessler, 2025).</p>

            <h3 class="syst">🌸 Workstations</h3>
            <p class="p3">A workstation is a powerful computer made for heavy professional tasks like 3D design, video editing, data analysis, and engineering work. It is more reliable and faster than a normal desktop, with stronger CPUs, GPUs, and larger memory. Workstations are built for accuracy and performance, and while they usually use more power, newer technology has made them more energy-efficient than before. This means that it is built for heavy professional tasks that need high processing power, advanced graphics, and large memory, which is different from regular computers that are made for everyday use like browsing, typing, or entertainment (Gerencer, 2025).</p>

            <h3 class="syst">🌸 Micro Computers</h3>
            <p class="p3">A microcomputer is a small computer that uses a microprocessor as its main processor and is used for everyday tasks like typing, gaming, communication, research, and more. Examples include laptops, desktops, tablets, and even smartphones. It is  different from other types of computers because it is smaller, cheaper, and made for personal or individual use, while others like servers, mainframes, or supercomputers are larger, more powerful, and designed to handle complex tasks for many users at once (Mhar & Whitsett, 2023).</p>

            <h2 class="conthead">The following are compared according to: processing speed, memory capacity, power consumption, minimum and usage.</h2>
        
            <h3 class="syst">🌸 Mini Computers</h3>
            <p class="p3">A mini computer has moderate processing speed and memory capacity, making it faster and more capable than a microcomputer but less powerful than a server. It can support several users at once, making it ideal for small businesses, schools, and laboratories. Its power consumption is moderate, and it is mainly used for managing data, running small-scale operations, and educational purposes.</p>
            
            <h3 class="syst">🌸 Micro Computers</h3>
            <p class="p3">A microcomputer has average processing speed and smaller memory compared to other types. It is designed for a single user and is used for simple tasks like word processing, internet browsing, and gaming. It consumes little power and is the most affordable and common type of computer, found in homes, schools, and offices.</p>

            <h3 class="syst">🌸 Workstation</h3>
            <p class="p3">A workstation offers higher processing speed and memory than a microcomputer or minicomputer. It is mainly used by professionals who do technical, scientific, or creative work such as 3D modeling, programming, or video editing. It is designed for one user, consumes moderate to high power, and provides excellent performance and reliability.</p>

            <h3 class="syst">🌸 Server</h3>
            <p class="p3">A server has very high processing speed and large memory capacity because it must handle data and requests from many users at the same time. It consumes more power than other types of computers but is built for constant operation and reliability. Servers are used in businesses and organizations to manage networks, host websites, and store large amounts of information.</p>
