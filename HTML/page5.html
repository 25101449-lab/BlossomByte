            <h1 class="headings">🌸 MOTHERBOARD 🌸</h1>
            <p class="p1">In a computer, the motherboard is the foundational and most important component. It acts as the main circuit board and central communication hub which serves as the system’s backbone and can essentially connect points that link all internal and external components such as the CPU, chipsets, and RAM, GPUs, and Wi-Fi. Motherboards come in different types which fit various computer designs and sizes. Each type is built to support only specific kinds of processors and memory modules, which makes them universally incompatible. Therefore, selecting the correct motherboard is crucial for hardware and software compatibility (Kirvan, 2025; ComputerHope, 2025).</p>

            <h1 class="headings">🌸 DISCUSSION 🌸</h1>
            <p class="p1">Over the years, designs of motherboards have evolved into many different form factors. This evolution has been primarily based on three key factors: the necessity for standardization, to achieve improved thermal management, and to create smaller computer footprints that take up less space. These includes:</p>
            
            <h2 class="system">AT AND ATX FAMILY</h2>
            <p class="p2">AT and ATX are the two types of motherboards used in computers. These motherboards are different in size and layout and features. The AT motherboards are old and simple while the ATX motherboards are new and advanced. The difference is how they are shaped, where the parts connect and their working. ATX boards bring the improvements that made computers work better and easier to use.</p>
           
            <h3 class="syst">🌸 AT</h3>
            <p class="p3">Advanced Technical motherboards were the standard in the 1980s. They were large and required specific AT cases. Their layout was simple: the processor and memory were in the top right, and the ISA expansion slots were along the bottom. They were simpler than modern boards, with fewer connectors (GeekforGeeks, 2025).</p>
            
            <h3 class="syst">🌸 ATX</h3>
            <p class="p3">Advanced Technology Extended motherboard is the modern standard used in most computers. Its design improves airflow and accessibility by placing the power connector at the top and spacing out the expansion slots along the bottom. The processor is centrally located with memory slots to its right. A key benefit of ATX is its enhanced power management, allowing users to control the computer's power state via the operating system (GeekforGeeks, 2025).</p>

            <h3 class="syst">🌸 Standard ATX</h3>
            <p class="p3">This motherboard is the current and most used for desktop computers. It is versatile and performs efficiently while also offering extensive features, ample space for upgrades and efficient cooling, which makes it ideal for enthusiasts. Its key feature is its innovative power management (CandT Solution, 2025).</p>

            <h3 class="syst">🌸 Extended ATX</h3>
            <p class="p3">This motherboard is a bigger version of the ATX standard, built for supporting powerful hardware and extensive upgrades. Its larger size can facilitate maximum capacity, which offers up to eight RAM slots for massive memory and multiple PCIe slots for advanced graphics or storage (Cashicia, 2025). </p>

            <h3 class="syst">🌸 Mini ATX</h3>
            <p class="p3">This is a compact and versatile motherboard form factor, commonly used in small Form Factor personal computers. It is significantly smaller than a standard ATX board and it is designed primarily for energy efficiency, Mini-ITX boards feature low power consumption, making them excellent choices for embedded systems and media centers (Ashtari, 2024).</p>

            <h3 class="syst">🌸 Micro ATX</h3>
            <p class="p3">This motherboard is a smaller alternative to the standard ATX. It is designed for use in smaller computer cases while still providing a good balance of size and functionality. This is highly versatile, which supports high-performance components and serves various needs, from gaming rigs and home servers to Home Theater PCs (Lenovo, 2025).</p>

            <h2 class="system">BTX FAMILY</h2>
            
            <h3 class="syst">🌸 BTX</h3>
            <p class="p3">Balanced Technology eXtended motherboard introduced by Intel, was developed to fix heat management and power consumption issues present in the ATX design. Its optimized layout creates better airflow and more efficient cooling, which enhances system performance and can extend hardware life. Additionally, the improved component arrangement in BTX systems also helps simplify assembly and maintenance (Lenovo, 2025). </p>

            <h3 class="syst">🌸 Pico-BTX</h3>
            <p class="p3">This motherboard is a smaller variation of the BTX design which offers only two expansion slots, which may be shared with the upper section of a standard BTX footprint. They support either half-height cards or use riser cards, making them suitable for digital applications where space is limited. It is designed for basic functionality in systems that have little need for numerous additional expansion cards (Wallen, 2024).</p>

            <h2 class="system">LPX FAMILY</h2>

            <h3 class="syst">🌸 LPX</h3>
            <p class="p3">The LPX (Low-Profile eXtended) motherboard, introduced by Western Digital in 1987, was designed specifically for slimline PC cases. Its defining feature was the use of a riser card: instead of plugging in perpendicular to the board, expansion cards plugged into the riser, making them lie parallel with the motherboard. However, LPX motherboards are largely outdated, having been replaced by newer form factors like NLX and ATX (PCMag, n.d.).</p>

            <h2 class="system">ITX FAMILY</h2>

            <h3 class="syst">🌸 ITX</h3>
            <p class="p3">Information Technology eXtended motherboard is a compact design geared toward specialized applications and systems with a minimal footprint. These boards are smaller than ATX components and are focused on energy efficiency and low power consumption. They offer fewer inputs and outputs and are not as versatile as full-sized ATX boards. They are commonly used in areas such as industrial automation, set-top boxes, and network devices where a powerful, yet small, system is required (AValue, 2024).</p>
