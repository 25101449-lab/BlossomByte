            <h1 class="headings">🌸NUMBER SYSTEMS🌸</h1>
            <p class="p1">The number system, also called the numeral system, is the way we name or show numbers. It is a method of writing that is used to express numbers. It’s a mathematical notation that represents numbers in a certain set by using digits or different symbols in a consistent way. It gives each number its own unique form and shows the arithmetic and algebraic structure of the values. It also lets us perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (Byjus, 2023).</p>
            <p class="p2">Number systems are mathematical systems that are used to show numbers in different forms and are also understood by computers. A number is a value in math that is used for counting or measuring things, and for doing arithmetic operations. A number system is basically a way of representing numbers. It is sometimes called a numeration system, and it sets a group of values to show a certain quantity. These values are used as digits, and the most common ones are 0 and 1, which are used to write binary numbers. Digits from 0 to 9 are used to represent other kinds of number systems (CueMath, n.d.).</p>
            <p class="p3">Moreover, a number system, also called a numeral system, is a way of showing numbers using symbols, and it’s important in math and programming for representing data. It uses digits to form numbers, and each digit’s meaning depends on its position and the base of the system. Computers mostly rely on the binary system made of 0s and 1s, but number systems are used in many fields for things like calculations, measuring, and labeling. There are different kinds of number systems, and each one is useful for certain purposes (Gaurav, 2022).</p>
            <p class="p4">A Number System is a way of showing numbers using a set of symbols and rules; it is a mathematical notation used to represent quantities or values in different forms. Number systems provide a structured method to write numbers, making arithmetic operations possible and keeping the notation clear and consistent. A number system uses a base, also called radix, to represent values, where the base is the total count of unique digits, including zero, that the system uses to write numbers. Each system has its own rules for representing numbers, and there are several kinds of number systems, such as: decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal (Geeksforgeeks, 2025).</p>
            <p class="p5">The base, or radix, of a number system in computer science is the number of digits or symbols used to show numerical values. In simple words, the base decides how many unique values a single digit can represent in the system. The most common number systems in computer science are the decimal system (base 10) which uses digits 0 to 9, the binary system (base 2) using 0 and 1, the octal system (base 8) using 0 to 7, and the hexadecimal system (base 16) which uses 0 to 9 and letters A to F. Generally, a number system with a higher base can show more unique values with fewer digits (Repostseo, 2023).</p>

            <h1 class="headings">🌸 DECIMAL 🌸</h1>
            <p class="p1">The decimal system in mathematics is a positional numeral system that uses 10 as its base and requires 10 different digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. It also uses a dot, called the decimal point, to represent fractional values. In this system, each digit in a number has a place value depending on its position (Britannica, 2025).</p>
            
            <table class="tabdec">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Example</th>
                    <th>Base</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>349</td>
                    <td>10</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
            </table>

            <p class="p2">The base-10 system, or decimal system, is the most widely used number system due to its simplicity and ease of use with 10 digits (0-9), which makes it natural and easy to understand for different purposes. Its positional notation allows efficient representation of numbers, and the decimal point enables accurate expression of fractions. These features make it essential in our daily lives, such as daily calculations to advanced scientific and mathematical work (Fiveable, 2024).</p>

            <h1 class="headings">🌸 BINARY 🌸</h1>
            <p class="p1">A binary number system is a system of numbers that uses only two symbols. It is also called the base-2 numeral system. In this system, numeric values are represented using just 1 (one) and 0 (zero) (Byjus, 2021).</p>
            
            <table class="tabdec">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Example</th>
                    <th>Base</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>11011</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
            </table>

            <p class="p2">The binary number system is a base-2 positional system that uses only two digits, 0 and 1. In digital computers, 1 represents the presence of an electrical signal and 0 represents its absence. Since electronic devices respond to electrical signals, the binary system provides a simple and reliable way to encode information. This binary representation forms the fundamental language of computers, allowing both data and instructions to be efficiently stored, processed, and transmitted within memory and hardware circuits (Schmit, 1995).</p>

        <div id="oct">
            <h1 class="headings">🌸 OCTAL 🌸</h1>
            <p class="p1">The Octal Number System is a base-8 system. It uses only eight digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7. Each digit in octal number shows a power of 8, and this system is important in computer science and digital electronics where binary numbers are converted for easier reading and grouping (Vedantu, 2025).</p>
            
            <table class="tabdec">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Example</th>
                    <th>Base</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>

            </tbody>
            </table>

            <p class="p2">The main advantage of octal numbers is that they use fewer digits than decimal or hexadecimal systems. So, it needs less calculations and has less computational errors. The octal system is widely used in computer applications and digital numbering. It is also used in aviation as a code. Octal is similar to hexadecimal because both can be easily converted to binary, where octal equals three-digit binary and hexadecimal equals four-digit binary (Jhawar, 2024).</p>

            <h1 class="headings">🌸 HEXADECIMAL 🌸</h1>
            <p class="p1">Hexadecimal is a number system that uses base-16 to show numeric values. It can represent big numbers with fewer digits. This system has 16 symbols, 0-9 and six letters A, B, C, D, E, F. These letters stand for decimal values 10 to 15 in single bits (Shacklett & Awati, 2025).</p>

            <h1 class="headings">🌸 ANALYSIS 🌸</h1>

            <p class="p1">I have learned that at every core of a computer, cellphone, or just technology in general, the number system plays an important role. It is the bridge between humans and computers, where they are able to communicate with each other. Not only does the number system help us advance technologically, it is also significant in daily calculations. I believe that understanding the number system helps us in building the foundation of all computing and digital technology.</P>
            <p class="p2">I have also learned that there are four different types of number systems: decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal. They represent how we are able to communicate and understand technology. Decimal number system is the system we use everyday, it is simple and familiar to all with its number ranging from 0-9. Additionally, the binary number system is also important especially in computers as it is the core of all its computations, it includes the numbers 0 and 1.. Next is the octal number system, it is a more compact and efficient way of representing binary numbers with its numbers ranging from 0-7. Last but not least is the hexadecimal number system, it is the most efficient and easiest way to write binary numbers, especially if it’s very lengthy. It is represented by the numbers 0-9 and letters A-F.</p>
            <p class="p3">In conclusion, the number systems are essential because they form the foundation of all digital technology. Understanding them helps us to perform calculations, conversions, problem solving, and especially programming. Moreover, learning number systems strengthens our logical and analytical thinking, allowing us to recognize patterns and understand how computers and other digital devices operate at their core. By mastering them, we gain insight into the technology around us and can interact with it more effectively and intelligently. You don’t always need complex solutions to achieve success; even the most advanced technology, from computers to smartphones, is built on simple foundations like the basic number systems that make all digital operations possible. </p>
