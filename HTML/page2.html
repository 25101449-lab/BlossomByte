            <h1 class="headings">🌸 DATA AND INFORMATION 🌸</h1>
            <p class="p1">Information is organized data that gains meaning for humans, it can include data but is not restricted with it. For example, binary code can be processed into numbers, language, or graphics that convey significance, and such collocations of data can be made meaningful by human beings. Data becomes information when it connects with broader cognitive frameworks, such as worldviews that include knowledge and wisdom. Beyond computer-based data, information also exists in natural and cultural forms that cannot be fully reduced to digital processing (Zins, 2007).</P>
            <p class="p2">Extracting information from data is an essential skill in computer science and many other fields. In simple terms, data is raw, unprocessed facts, while information is what we get after giving those facts context and meaning. Turning data into useful information can be challenging, especially when cleaning messy data or combining different sources. By refining data and looking for connections, we can identify patterns that help solve real problems. Although correlation doesn’t always prove cause, it’s still a helpful clue in research. Often, linking different data sources reveals hidden insights. Learning how to process data well is important, as it can lead to new discoveries that shape the future (TeamA, 2025).</p>
            <p class="p3">Data can be understood as a collection of symbols or perceptible differences in the world, which may hold potential meaning but are not always interpretable by a recipient. It represents an abstract message that might or might not contain information. Information emerges when the informational potential of data is realized, which is the process of data being received, perceived, and translated into knowledge. The difference between the two is subtle: information is not only built into data but also arises through human interpretation, with meaning varying depending on who interprets it (KO, n.d.).</p>

            <h1 class="headings">🌸 INFORMATION SYSTEMS 🌸</h1>

            <p class="p1">An information system is a set of components—people, hardware, software, networks, data, and procedures—that collect, process, and share data. Compared to IT that focuses mainly on technology and maintaining systems, IS takes a broader view and is concerned by also emphasizing the role of people in these processes. Information systems are a vital tool used by all types of organizations to conduct business and participate in the marketplace, whether local or global (Raisinghani, 2025).</P>
            <p class="p2">It is a set of interconnected components that gather, process, store, and distribute information while using feedback to support organizational goals. This feedback helps improve decision-making, enhance customer service, increase efficiency, and ultimately boost profits. Companies rely on IS to raise revenues and reduce costs. Within organizations, IS is commonly structured around four key elements identified by Harold Leavitt in the 1960s, a model known as the “Leavitt Diamond” (Zemmouchi-Ghomari, 2021).</p>
            <p class="p3">Additionally, information system is a combination of technologies and software that work together to support the goals of individuals, groups, organizations, or even society. In simple terms, it uses information technology to collect, process, store, and share information. Everyday devices like smartphones, music players, and digital cameras function as personal information systems because they use different technologies to manage information. Likewise, tools such as databases, networks, and programming languages are combined to build larger systems for organizations (Richard, 2007).</p>
            <p class="p4">Information system is a structured setup that combines people, technology, data, and processes to collect, store, process, and share information within an organization. It includes hardware like physical devices, software such as instructions and applications, networks for communication, and data resources for storage and retrieval, all guided by policies and procedures. While modern IS often involves computers, information systems have existed since early civilization, and many systems we use daily to manage and share information still function without computers (O’Brien and Marakas, 2010).</p>
            <p class="p5">Moreover, information system is designed to provide knowledge, facts, data, and insights that users need to carry out their work or business. Because this covers a wide range of situations, the focus here is on general-purpose, file-oriented information systems, with attention to the trade-offs that matter to users, designers, implementers, and operators, especially in terms of management. These systems play a key role in organizing and structuring data so it can be efficiently accessed and used. By balancing functionality and usability, they ensure that information supports both operational needs and decision-making processes (Aron, 1969).</p>

            <h1 class="headings">🌸 SUPPORT SYSTEMS 🌸</h1>

            <p class="p1">Support systems in IS range from transaction-level systems (TPS) that handle daily operations, to managerial systems (MIS & DSS) that support planning and control, up to executive systems (ESS) that guide long-term strategy. Specialized systems like KMS, ES, OAS, and GDSS further enhance knowledge sharing, expert problem-solving, office efficiency, and group collaboration.</P>
            
            <h3 class="soft">🌸 Transaction Processing Systems (TPS)</h3>
            <p class="p1">Transaction processing systems (TPS) handle routine organizational tasks by recording and updating transactions in real time. They manage functions such as accounts, invoicing, inventory, and ledgers, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and efficiency—making them essential to business operations (Yull, 2009).</p>
            
            <h3 class="soft">🌸 Management Information Systems (MIS)</h3>
            <p class="p1">Management Information Systems (MIS) lies at the intersection of business and computing, playing a key role in the shift from paper-based to digital systems. It requires knowledge of business fields like accounting, finance, and marketing, as well as IT areas such as software development, data science, and networking (Michigan Technological University, 2025).</p>
            
            <h3 class="soft">🌸 Decision Support System (DSS)</h3>
            <p class="p1">A decision support system (DSS) is a computer-based tool that enhances organizational decision-making by analyzing large datasets and presenting optimal options. It integrates data and knowledge from various sources, offering insights beyond standard reports to help organizations make well-informed choices (Gillis, 2024).</p>
            
            <h3 class="soft">🌸 Executive Information System (EIS)</h3>
            <p class="p1">An executive information system (EIS), also known as an executive support system (ESS), is a management tool designed to assist senior executives in decision-making. It provides quick access to both internal and external information aligned with organizational goals and is considered a specialized form of decision support system (DSS) (Techslang, 2025).</p>
            
            <h3 class="soft">🌸 Knowledge Management System (KMS)</h3>
            <p class="p1">A knowledge management system (KMS) is an IT solution that organizes content, search, and insights to support functions like customer service, sales, HR, training, and internal helpdesks. Beyond technology, it also involves people, processes, and culture, making it a critical tool for business success (eGain, 2025).</p>
            
            <h3 class="soft">🌸 Expert System</h3>
            <p class="p1">An expert system is an advanced computer program that simulates human reasoning and problem-solving by applying a knowledge base and rule-based algorithms. It allows users to input queries and receive solutions through its inference engine, which interprets data using predefined rules to deliver accurate responses (EBSCO, n.d.).</p>
            
            <h3 class="soft">🌸 Office Automation</h3>
            <p class="p1">Office automation refers to computer systems and software that digitally collect, store, transfer, and process office information to complete tasks. It streamlines data management and enables information to move efficiently with minimal human intervention (SolveXia, 2025).</p>
            
            <h3 class="soft">🌸 Group Decision-Support System (GDSS)</h3>
            <p class="p1">A group decision-support system (GDSS) is an interactive computer-based tool designed to help groups solve unstructured problems collectively. It offers technologies that enhance collaboration and decision-making, created to improve the quality and effectiveness of meetings (Nunamaker et al., n.d.).</p>

            <h1 class="headings">🌸 ANALYSIS 🌸</h1>

            <p class="p1">In this portfolio, I was able to learn all about data and knowledge, information systems, and its different types. In the very first part, I learned all about data and knowledge and their differences. Data is a collection of raw facts and statistics which includes categories such as age, name, blood type, etc. These data have no significance because they cannot be interpreted. However, once data has the potential to be processed, it becomes an information. This indicates that the information provides data with context and usefulness. Even though the two are different, they form a connection and work together to create a basis of knowledge and guide actions especially to human beings. </P>
            <p class="p2"> I have also learned all about Information Systems. It is a set of components that are able to gather, collect, and analyze information. It is most beneficial to companies, especially in businesses because information and data are being handled carefully to successfully keep their business on-going. The information included are about the company, customers, the product they sell, and the business itself all together. Information systems are connected with Information technology but this field focuses more on the protection and processing of information rather than the programming to create something.  Moreover, information systems provide the  balance of functionality and usability, which ensures that information supports both operational needs and decision-making processes. </p>
            <p class="p3">Lastly, I have learned about the different types of information systems. Namely transaction processing systems, management information systems, decision support systems, executive information systems, knowledge management systems, expert systems, office automation, and group-decision support systems. These systems have different roles to play but each one of them plays a crucial role in making information systems the way that it is. These systems provide further enhancements of how information should be processed and managed and improve the people who handle information. </p>
