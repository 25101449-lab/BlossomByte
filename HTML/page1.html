            <h1 class="headings">🌸 COMPUTER SCIENCE 🌸</h1>
            <p class="p1">In the early 1940s, the discipline of computer science was born. This was the convergence of algorithm theory, mathematical logic, and the invention of the stored-program electronic computer. The discipline of computer science is used by computer scientists or computing professionals in their work and is the body of knowledge. This is occasionally called the systematic study of algorithm processes that explain and transform information such as theories, analysis, design, and application (Denning, 1997).</p>
            <p class="p2">Computer science, as a discipline, is also a junction of central processes, such as applied mathematics, science, and engineering. This gives equal and fundamental importance to these while blending theory, abstraction, and design. It is held together by a shared focus on experimenting and designs ways to transform information, by using computation to support every stage of these processes, and by a common concern for working efficiently (Denning et al., 1989).</p>
            <p class="p3">There are a variety of scientific disciplines in computers and computing. Computer science offers numerous ways of explaining phenomena; most notably, it provides computational models and algorithms. Because of this, efforts in computer science have been paralleled by the recognition of the growing number of computing-centered fields. Examples include computer engineering, scientific computation, electrical engineering, decision support systems, architectural design, and software engineering (Tedre, 2007).</p>
            <p class="p4">Computer science is associated with the disciplines of engineering , mathematics, and the sciences. These disciplines are considered as hard disciplines, relying on precise, formal, and quantitative methods rather than interpretive or qualitative ones. It is also viewed as applied, meaning that computer science uses existing knowledge to solve practical problems. However, despite the difficulties of these disciplines, they remain valuable because they provide the context in which theories and concepts make sense. It is concerned not only with solutions but also with how problems are defined and approached (Clark, 2003).</p>
            <p class="p5">Similar to traditional engineering disciplines, computer science is concerned with producing useful technologies such as microprocessors, software, and databases, with efficiency as one of its defining characteristics. Unlike creative arts, computer science is built on specific scientific principles like Boolean algebra, computability theory, automata, and formal languages. This goes on to say that computer science represents a new kind of engineering (Loui, 1995).</p>

            <h1 class="headings">🌸 DISCIPLINE AND MAJORS 🌸</h1>

            <h3 class="comp">🌸 Computer Science</h3>
            <p class="p1">Computer science mainly deals with both the practical applications and theoretical foundations of computing. This includes the areas of algorithms, programming, database management, cybersecurity, operating systems, and machine learning. Scientists or professionals in this field often work on designs and development of software and systems, making them have a significant role in the progress of modern computing. For example is the role of computer science in video games designs where it highlights how creativity and technology come together in today’s most dynamic sectors (University of Brighton, n.d.). </p>
            
            <h3 class="comp">🌸 Information Technology</h3>
            <p class="p2">Information Technology focuses on the practical use of computing, managing infrastructure such as hardware, software, data storage, networks, and communication systems which are aspects of technology infrastructure. Professionals in this field ensure that organizations across sectors, from business, healthcare, government, and education have the right tools and support to meet their technology needs. Their work includes selecting and integrating hardware and software, installing and securing networks, developing web and multimedia resources, managing communication systems, and planning and managing the full technology lifecycle (Connolly et al., 2017).</p>
            
            <h3 class="comp">🌸 Software Engineering</h3>
            <p class="p3">Software engineering is focused on the maintaining and development of reliable, efficient, and cost-effective systems that meet customer requirements. It is essential due to the scale of modern software and its role in safety-critical applications. It combines significant principles from mathematics, computer science, which are in engineering. Additionally, software engineers work in teams to design, test, document, and improve programs while collaborating with stakeholders to refine user needs. Their role emphasizes big-picture design, which it often includes writing original code (Association for Computing Machinery, 2005).</p>
            
            <h3 class="comp">🌸 Computer Engineering</h3>
            <p class="p4">Computer engineering encompasses broad areas of combined electrical engineering and computer science. It is a discipline that focuses on the technology of design, construction, implementation, and maintenance of both hardware and software in modern computing systems and equipment. It integrates the principles of hardware design from electrical engineering with software development principles of computer science, which allows professionals to work on software creation, system integration, analysis, testing, and maintenance. Because of this, the field plays a vital role in advancing technology by bridging the gap between hardware and software to create efficient and reliable solutions (Association for Computing Machinery and IEEE Computer Society, 2016).</p>
            
            <h3 class="comp">🌸 Data Science</h3>
            <p class="p5">As a discipline, data science focuses on using scientific methods and processes to analyze data and uncover meaningful information. It is a field that is integrative because it is a combination of expertise from statistics, mathematics, and computer science. This makes it versatile where it enables applications in areas like healthcare, marketing, finance, and environmental research. Skills and knowledge gained from the field can equip professionals to pursue careers such as data analyst, data scientist, machine learning engineer, or data engineer (Paulson, 2025).</p>

            <h1 class="headings">🌸 ANALYSIS 🌸</h1>

            <p class="p1">The study of computer science raises the question of what this field really is and how it differs from different areas of computing. The discussion “Computer Science as a Discipline and Computing Disciplines and Majors” answers this question by exploring and presenting computing as a collection of different but somehow interconnected fields. This made me reflect on how important it is to recognize computing as a diverse discipline that supports innovation in every aspect of modern life. </p>
            <p class="p2">In computer science, a discipline represents a distinct academic and professional field that brings together various theories, methods, knowledge, and principles for designing and analyzing computational systems. This helps me understand how disciplines play a significant role in driving innovation and creating technologies that make life easier and more accessible to people. I realized that this does not only expand one’s knowledge but also deepens understanding of the field, which as time passes, our computational systems continue to evolve and improve thanks to the contributions of these disciplines.</p>
            <p class="p3">As an IT student, I find this topic both interesting and helpful because it broadens my knowledge of computer science and computing. It explores the various disciplines and majors within the field, providing explanations of each aspect. I also discovered that this field offers many career paths for students, each playing a significant role in shaping technology. These paths contribute to creating tools and systems that make modern life simpler and more accessible for people today. .</p>
            <p class="p4">My main insights from this topic are that each discipline holds its own importance because computer science functions through the combination of these fields. Together, they form the foundation that makes computer science what it is today. As a student in this field, understanding these computing disciplines motivates me to explore my chosen field more deeply and prepares me to use this knowledge in practical ways. With technology constantly evolving, I believe these disciplines will continue to grow and give more opportunities for learning and innovation in the future.</p>
